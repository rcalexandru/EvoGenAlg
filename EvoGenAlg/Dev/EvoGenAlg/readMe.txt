Each square is either black or white. Some of the black squares have already been filled in for you.
Each row or column is labelled with a string of numbers. 
The numbers indicate the length of all consecutive runs of black squares and are displayed in the order that the runs appear in that line. 
For example, a label "2 1 6" indicates sets of two, one and six black squares, each of which will have at least one white square separating them
